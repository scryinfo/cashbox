How Do We Protect Your Personal Information</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">We provide appropriate safety guarantee for your information to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure of information.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">5.1 We strictly abide by laws and regulations to protect communication secrets of users.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">5.2 We will take a variety of security measures within a reasonable level of security to guarantee the security of information. For example, we use encryption techniques (e.g., TLS, SSL), anonymization, and other means to protect your personal information.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">5.3 We set up specialized management systems, processes and organizations to ensure information security. For example, we strictly limit the number of people who access information and require them to perform confidentiality obligations and conduct reviews.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">5.4 In case of personal information leakage or other security incidents, we will initiate contingency plans to prevent the expansion of security incidents and notify you in the form of push notifications, announcements, etc.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">5.5 We will take all reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that irrelevant personal information is not collected.

We recommend that you use complex passwords when using such tools, and pay attention to protecting the security of your personal information.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">5.7 The Internet environment is not 100% secure, and we will do our best to ensure or guarantee the security of any information you send to us. If our physical, technical, administrative or protective facilities are damaged, resulting in unauthorized access to information, public disclosure, manipulation, or destruction, as well as damage to your legitimate rights and interests, we will assume corresponding legal responsibility.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"><br>VI. How Do We Save Your Personal Information</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">6.1 We implement appropriate physical, electronic, administrative and technical measures to protect and safeguard your personal data. We endeavour to ensure that any personal data collected through our platform is free from interference from third parties not related to us. The security measures we take include but are not limited to:</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">6.1.1 Physical measures: the records containing your personal data will be stored in a locked place.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">6.1.2 Electronic measures: computer data containing your personal data will be stored on computer systems and storage media subject to strict log-in restrictions.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">6.1.3 Management measures: we have set up relevant departments for the security protection of user information, established relevant internal control systems, and adopted strict authorization principles for staff who may have access to your information. Only our authorized staff will have access to your personal data and these staff will be subject to our internal code of conduct on the confidentiality of personal data. In addition, we constantly provide staff with trainings of relevant laws, regulations and privacy safety to strengthen their awareness of safety, and regularly organize internal relevant personnel to conduct emergency response trainings and emergency drills, so that they can master the post responsibilities and emergency response strategies and procedures</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">6.1.4 Technical measures: encryption technology such as Secure Socket Layer Encryption may be used to transfer your personal data.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">6.1.5 Security measures: to ensure the security of your information, we are committed to using a variety of current and general security technologies and supporting management systems to minimize the risks of information disclosure, damage, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, and change. For example, the network security layer software (SSL) is used for transmission encryption, information encryption and storage, thus severely restricting access to the data center. When transmitting and storing personal sensitive information (including personal biometric information), we will adopt security measures such as encryption, permission control, de-identification and desensitization.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">6.1.6 Other measures: we will regularly review our procedures for the collection, storage and processing of personal data; restrict the access of our employees and suppliers to your data according to the necessary principles; and require our employees and suppliers to comply with strict contractual confidentiality obligations.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">6.2 If you are aware of any security vulnerabilities on our platform, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate action as soon as possible.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">6.3 Despite the implementation of the above technical and security measures, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of data transmission on the Internet, so we cannot absolutely guarantee that the personal information you provide to us through our platform will be secure at all times. We will update and publicize the security risk, assessment report on security impact of personal information and other relevant contents from time to time, which can be obtained through the announcement on this platform.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">VII. How Do You Manage Your Information</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">7.1 Create A Wallet</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">You must first create a wallet on the platform before using this software services.

Therefore, you need to remember the wallet password (i.e. the password set by the user when creating/importing the wallet), private key, mnemonics or Keystore by yourself. We cannot provide you with the services such as retrieving the wallet password, private key, mnemonics or Keystore of users, freezing, reporting loss and recovering the wallet, or rolling back the transaction.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">7.3 Inquire, correct and delete your information</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">You have the right to inquire, correct or supplement your information.
